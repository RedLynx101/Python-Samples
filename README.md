## Requirements & Setup

- Each project may have its own `requirements.txt` file in its directory. Install dependencies for a project by running:
  ```
  pip install -r path/to/project/requirements.txt
  ```
- The root `requirements.txt` is for shared or legacy dependencies. Use it for general utilities or if a project does not have its own file.
